# The new adventure for me - Ender-3 V3 SE with some hardware mods  
One of the few mods i had done on the very beggining:  
<ol>
  <li>Installing Klipper on my Dell Wyse 3040 terminal, and connecting it to Ender</li>
  <li>Linear rail X-axis</li>
  <li>Linear rail Y-axis</li>
  <li>Ceramic hot-end swap from Creality K1 printer (so i can print TPU and other flex'es)</li>
  <li>Cooling replacement for a central 40mm fan and 2nd one cooling off prints</li>
  <li>Reverse bowden tube and moving the filament spool out of Z-axis to the side of the printer (no more z wobble) </li>
</ol>  

# DISCLAIMER
I used the hardware mostly from AliExpress (rails and stuff), I'll propably post links lil'bit later.
