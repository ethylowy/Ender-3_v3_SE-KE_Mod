# ;TLDR
This profile will work on stock printer running Klipper - You don't need to mod anything. Just choose right settings. 

# DISCLAIMER
This is a new adventure in 3D Printing for me, as I moved from Artillery Hornet (quite modded actually) to a bit better Ender3 v3 SE.<br>
Many thanks to everyone, who contributed, and helped me with setting profiles and tweaking stuff.<br>
Some of my PrusaSlicer profile settings are based on Sims' work, which can be found here : https://github.com/suchmememanyskill/PrusaSlicer-Ender3-v3-SE-Config

# MODS  
One of the few mods i had done at the very beggining:  
<ol>
  <li>Installing Klipper on my Dell Wyse 3040 terminal, and connecting it to Ender</li>
  <li>Linear rail X-axis</li>
  <li>Linear rail Y-axis</li>
  <li>Ceramic hot-end swap from Creality K1 printer (so i can print TPU and other flex'es)</li>
  <li>Oryginal Bowden inside Sprite extruder changed to Capricorn</li>
  <li>Cooling replacement for a central 40mm fan and 2nd one cooling off prints</li>
  <li>Reverse bowden tube and moving the filament spool out of Z-axis to the side of the printer - no more Z-axis wobble nad ability to print straight from drybox.</li>
</ol>
