# The new adventure for me - Ender-3 V3 SE with some hardware mods
One of the few mods i had done on the very beggining:
1.Installing Klipper on my Dell Wyse 3040 terminal, and connecting it to Ender
2.Linear rail X-axis
3.Linear rail Y-axis
4.Ceramic hot-end swap from Creality K1 printer (so i can print TPU and other flex'es)
5.Cooling replacement for a central 40mm fan and 2nd one cooling off prints
6.Reverse bowden tube and moving the filament spool out of Z-axis to the side of the printer (no more z wobble)

# DISCLAIMER
I used the hardware mostly from AliExpress (rails and stuff), I'll propably post links lil'bit later.
